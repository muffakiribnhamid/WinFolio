        ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Muffakir, a 17-year-old coder, dreamer, and occasional
        snack enthusiast. By day, I juggle school, coding marathons, and leading
        a community of aspiring developers. By night, I fight bugs (in code, not
        my room...well, mostly). When Iâ€™m not busy cracking JavaScript mysteries
        or teaching Kashmiri (yes, I'm multilingual and proud!), you can find me
        planning my week like a Notion pro or turning caffeine into code. I've
        dabbled in mobile and web app development, explored cool tech at events,
        and mastered the art of saying "just one more feature" at 2 AM. <br/> <span className="text-red-500 underline">Fun
        fact</span>: I firmly believe in debugging life with a good laugh and a great
        playlist. Let's create something epicâ€”or just argue about tabs vs.
        spaces. Your call. ðŸ˜Ž
